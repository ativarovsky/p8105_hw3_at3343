# P8105 Homework 3

Setup:

Instacart Data

## Problem 1

### Instacart Data

Loading data and generating preview:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
view(head(instacart, n = 50))
```

The instacart dataset contains 1,384,617 observations and 15 variables.
It catalogues instacart orders from October 2017 in New York City. Key
variables include order\_id (the order identifier), user\_id (the
customer identifier), product\_id (the product name within each order),
and order\_dow (the day of the week). The first row, for example, is
order\_id = 1, meaning it was the first order in October 2017, includes
(among 7 other items) the item product\_name = Bulgarian Yogurt, which
was ordered by customer user\_id = 112108 on order\_dow = 4 (presumably
Wednesday).
